	<h1>What is Centifolia Roses?</h1>
	<p>With colors ranging from white to rich pink, Centifolia Roses have large, closely-packed blooms with thin, overlapping petals. They also have an intense fragrance that makes them highly demanded by the perfume industry.
	</p><br><p>First developed by Dutch nurserymen in the late 16th century, Rosa centifolia was said to have more than 100 petals, and its rounded shape gave rise to its English name of the 'Cabbage Rose'.</p>

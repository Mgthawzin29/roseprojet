		<dt><h1> What is Tea Rose?</h1> </dt>
		<dd>Tea Roses are repeat-flowering roses named because their fragrance is similar to that of Chinese black tea. They have pointed buds that open in a spiral manner and roll back at the edges.

The look of this particular rose plant creates a unique, classic, and delicate form that distinguishes the Tea Roses from the others in the Rosa genus. Tea roses come in shades of yellow, white, apricot, and pastel shades of pink.</dd>
